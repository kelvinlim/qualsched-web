# lnpitask host runbook (QualSched Web)

Do this **on lnpitask.umn.edu** in Cursor. This agent does not deploy.

Production is Podman Quadlets + host nginx location blocks — not compose.
Same pattern as [wearable-hub](https://github.com/kelvinlim/wearable-hub) `deploy/`
and `scripts/deploy.sh`.

Public URL: **https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/**

| | QualSched | wearable-hub (do not reuse) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path prefix | `/qualsched` only | `/wearable` |
| Host ports | **8050** backend, **8060** frontend (loopback) | 8010 / 8020 |
| Units | backend + frontend. **No scheduler.** | backend + scheduler + frontend |
| MariaDB | External `cnc3.med.umn.edu`, schema/user `qualsched` | `wearable_hub` |
| MariaDB on lnpitask | None | None |

Do not occupy `/wearable/`, `/enroll`, `/webhooks`, `/qualtrics_dashboard`, `/tictech/`, or ports 8000 / 8010 / 8020 / 8030 / 8040 (tictech already uses 8030/8040).

PHI stays in Qualtrics. Never commit `.env` or real DB passwords.

## 1. Checkout

```bash
# analogue of /home/kolim/Projects/wearable-hub
cd /home/kolim/Projects
git clone https://github.com/kelvinlim/qualsched-web.git
cd qualsched-web
```

If the tree already exists, `git pull` the commit you want to ship.
Quadlet `EnvironmentFile=` is `/home/kolim/Projects/qualsched-web/.env` — edit the
unit if the checkout path is different.

## 2. `.env`

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Fill in (never commit this file):

| Variable | Production value |
| --- | --- |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `prod` (disables the local dev-login bypass) |
| `FERNET_KEY` | `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` |
| `SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` | bootstrap researcher emails, comma-separated |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | `umn.edu` (auto-provision regular researchers; not `gmail.com`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `mysql+pymysql://qualsched:<password>@cnc3.med.umn.edu:3306/qualsched` |
| `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` | `qualsched` (not `wearable_hub`) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | the cnc3 password Kelvin provisions — placeholder in `.env.sample` only |
| `DB_WAIT_HOST` | `cnc3.med.umn.edu` |
| `DB_WAIT_PORT` | `3306` |
| `PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIX` | `/qualsched` |
| `RESEARCHER_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/auth/callback` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Dedicated **QualSched** OAuth 2.0 web client (External, **In production**). Do **not** reuse wearable-hub / `fitbitdata-499001`. |

Optional: `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` in `.env` so
`scripts/deploy.sh` can re-export them through `sudo -E podman build`.

## 3. Provision schema/user on cnc3 (Kelvin)

On **cnc3.med.umn.edu** (phpMyAdmin or `mariadb`), create a new schema and user
named `qualsched`. Do **not** reuse `wearable_hub` or its credentials. Put the
real password only in the host `.env` (`DB_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL` must
match). Collation **utf8mb4_unicode_ci** (not `general_ci` / `*_nopad_*`).
The account host must be **`%`** so lnpitask can connect (`qualsched`@`localhost`
is not enough). Use `IDENTIFIED BY` (modern `mysql_native_password`), not an
old-hash password.

Example (password is yours; do not commit it):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE qualsched CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'qualsched'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '...';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON qualsched.* TO 'qualsched'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Alembic runs from the backend entrypoint on first start (`alembic upgrade head`).
There is no MariaDB container on lnpitask.

## 4. Google OAuth (dedicated QualSched project)

Do **not** reuse wearable-hub’s GCP project `fitbitdata-499001` or its web client.
That app is External / Testing (100 test users) and requests Google Health scopes.
QualSched only needs **openid email profile**.

Create a **new** Cloud project (name e.g. `qualsched-web`; prefer the umn.edu org).
Record the project ID here once it exists: *(fill in after Console create)*.

### Consent screen

Deploy the public Privacy and Terms pages (this repo’s `/privacy` and `/terms`)
**before** saving the Branding URLs. Google fetches them with no login; localhost
is not accepted for production branding.

Google Auth Platform → **Branding**:

1. User type **External**. App name **QualSched**. Support + developer contact: a
   monitored **umn.edu** mailbox (e.g. `kolim@umn.edu`).
2. **Do not upload an app logo.** A logo forces brand verification unless the app
   stays in Testing. QualSched only uses `openid email profile`, so you can publish
   without one.
3. Authorized domain **`umn.edu`**. Paste these URLs (must already be live on
   lnpitask):

   | Field | URL |
   | --- | --- |
   | Application home page | `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/` |
   | Privacy policy | `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/privacy` |
   | Terms of service | `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/terms` |

   Use `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/` as the home page only if Google requires a
   host-only URL.
4. Scopes: **openid**, **email**, **profile** only. No Health / Fitbit scopes.
5. **Publish app** (Testing → **In production**). That removes the 100-user cap.
   Users may see “Google hasn’t verified this app” until brand verification;
   they can continue. Skip CASA unless you add sensitive scopes later.

Publishing does **not** bypass the QualSched allowlist (§4b). It only lets Google
issue tokens to more than 100 testers.

### Web client

Credentials → Create **OAuth client ID** → **Web application**:

- Authorized JavaScript origins: `https://lnpitask.umn.edu`
- Authorized redirect URIs (exact; no trailing slash on the callback):
  - `https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:8040/auth/callback` (local compose)

Must match `RESEARCHER_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`. A missing prod URI is Google
`Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch`. Put the client id/secret only in the host
`.env`, then `sudo systemctl restart qualsched-backend.service` (no image rebuild).

## 4b. Researcher allowlist

Google proving identity is not enough. The app then checks, in order:

1. **An existing `users` row** — that Google email can sign in (regular or
   superuser as stored). Covers Gmail colleagues you insert by hand.
2. **`SUPERADMIN_EMAILS`** in `.env` — comma-separated Google emails. First login
   creates a **superuser**. Restart `qualsched-backend` after editing `.env`.
3. **`ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`** — comma-separated domains (lnpitask: `umn.edu`).
   First login creates a **regular** researcher. Matches `@umn.edu` and
   subdomains (`@med.umn.edu`). Do **not** add `gmail.com`.

Deleting a `users` row does **not** ban a `@umn.edu` account while the domain
is still allowed; they are recreated on next login. There is no denylist yet.

`Forbidden: This Google account is not authorized` means the address is on
none of those lists. Gmail is not implied by `umn.edu`.

If the QualSched OAuth client is still **External / Testing**, Google’s 100
test-user cap still applies even when `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=umn.edu`. Publish
the QualSched consent screen to **In production** (§4). Wearable-hub’s
`fitbitdata-499001` client is unrelated.

## 5. Install Quadlets

```bash
sudo cp deploy/quadlet/qualsched.network \
        deploy/quadlet/qualsched-backend.container \
        deploy/quadlet/qualsched-frontend.container \
        /etc/containers/systemd/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Do not copy a scheduler unit — there is none. Do not add a db container.

Images are built by `scripts/deploy.sh` (`localhost/qualsched-backend:latest` and
`localhost/qualsched-frontend:latest`) before the first start.

## 6. Merge host nginx snippet

Copy the `location` blocks from [nginx/qualsched.conf](nginx/qualsched.conf) into
the existing `server { }` that already terminates TLS for `lnpitask.umn.edu`
(typically `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` or a vhost include). Live file is outside the repo.

- Do **not** add a second `server` / `listen` / `ssl` block.
- `location /qualsched/` proxies to `http://127.0.0.1:8060/` and **strips** the
  prefix (trailing URI on `proxy_pass`), same as `/wearable/` → 8020.

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
```

## 7. Build, start, health-check

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh            # backend + frontend
# scripts/deploy.sh backend  # backend only
# scripts/deploy.sh frontend # frontend only
```

That is `sudo -E podman build` per image, `systemctl restart` of the matching
units, then:

- backend: `curl http://localhost:8050/health`
- frontend: `curl http://localhost:8060/` (container sees `/`, not `/qualsched/`)

Logs: `sudo journalctl -u qualsched-backend.service -f`

Then open https://lnpitask.umn.edu/qualsched/

## Local compose vs this host

`docker-compose.yml` is local-only (sidecar MariaDB `db` on host 3307). It is not
used on lnpitask. Production reads `.env` (cnc3) via the Quadlet `EnvironmentFile`.

## SPA prefix

The production frontend image is built with Vite `base: /qualsched/`
(`VITE_BASE` ARG in `frontend/Dockerfile`; default `/qualsched/`). Browser
requests stay under the prefix (`/qualsched/assets/…`, `/qualsched/api/…`,
`/qualsched/auth/…`). Host nginx still **strips** `/qualsched/` so the
container sees `/`. Fetches join `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.

Local `vite` / `npm run dev` and local compose leave `base` at `/` so
`http://localhost:8040/` is unchanged. The Vite proxy stays `/api` `/auth`
`/health` on `/`. There is no History router — screens are in-memory.
